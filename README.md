# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Recreated Conway's Game of Life with all the rules in C++

## INFO 

The cells are randomly generated and you can chnage the percentage of cells that cover the board ex 80% using the controls. You can speed up or slow donw
the time it takes for a generation to progress. You can also pause the simulation and hide the ui. The ammount of cells in the board and the window size 
can be changed as you please through the top of the code when WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT and ARRAY_LEN are defined. The code has comments in it to guide 
someone throught the process of altering the code as they please. 

NOTE : ARRAY_LEN is the length of a 2D array both in the y-axis and the x-axis meaning that the number of cells in the board are ARRAY_LEN^2
